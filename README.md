## I'm Soun-Ja ðŸ‘‹

I will be starting my PhD in Applied Statistics in the Fall of 2025. I really want to apply all the theory I am learning to real problems. To accomplish this, I am doubling down on learning Python and R.

I am a proud cat lady ðŸ˜¸ and hope to build something that will one day improve the lives of cats and kittens in my community.
